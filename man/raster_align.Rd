\title{Align and Mask Raster Files to a Reference Raster}
\usage{
raster_align(
  input_dir,
  output_dir,
  reference_raster,
  output_suffix = "_Masked_Updated",
  pattern = ".*\\\\.tif$",
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_dir}{Character. Directory containing the input raster files.}

\item{output_dir}{Character. Directory where processed rasters will be saved.}

\item{reference_raster}{Character or `SpatRaster` or `RasterLayer`.
File path or raster object used as the alignment reference.}

\item{output_suffix}{Character. Suffix appended to output filenames.
Default is `"_Masked_Updated"`.}

\item{pattern}{Character. Character pattern used to match raster files within
`input_dir`. Default is `"\\.tif$"`.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. If `TRUE`, all files are creating overwriting files
with the same name in a given directory. If `FALSE`,
  existing processed files are skipped. Default is `FALSE`.}
}
\description{
This utility function standardizes multiple raster files so that they share
the same CRS, resolution, and spatial extent as a reference raster. Useful
for ensuring that all rasters are properly aligned and don't cause errors later
on in modeling or analyses.
}
\details{
Aligns a batch of raster files to a specified reference raster by performing
reprojection, resampling, and masking operations. All output rasters are
written to an output directory with a user-defined filename suffix.


For each raster in `input_dir` matching `pattern`, the function:
\enumerate{
  \item Reprojects it to the CRS of the reference raster.
  \item Resamples it (bilinear) to match the reference resolution.
  \item Masks values outside the reference raster's non-`NA` area.
  \item Saves the result as a GeoTIFF to `output_dir`.
}
}
