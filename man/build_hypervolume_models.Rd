\usage{
build_hypervolume_models(
  partition_results,
  model_vars,
  method,
  output_dir = "./Hypervolume_Models",
  hypervolume_params = list(),
  create_plot = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{partition_results}{List or character. Output from
\code{\link{spatiotemporal_partition}} or path to .rds file containing
partition results.}

\item{model_vars}{Character vector. Names of predictor columns to use in
hypervolume construction.}

\item{method}{Character. Hypervolume method, either "gaussian" for Gaussian
kernel density estimation or "svm" for one-class SVM. Required parameter.}

\item{output_dir}{Character. Directory to write output files. Default is
"./Hypervolume_Models".}

\item{hypervolume_params}{Named list. Additional parameters passed to
\code{\link[hypervolume]{hypervolume_gaussian}} or
\code{\link[hypervolume]{hypervolume_svm}}. Default is empty list.}

\item{create_plot}{Logical. If TRUE, generates visualization plots of
hypervolumes. If FALSE, skips plot generation. Default is TRUE.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. If TRUE, overwrites existing hypervolume files.
If FALSE, loads existing files when available. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item hypervolumes: list of hypervolume objects for each fold
  \item volumes: numeric vector of hypervolume sizes
  \item overlaps: matrix of pairwise hypervolume overlaps
  \item method: character indicating method used
  \item model_vars: character vector of variables used
  \item output_dir: path to output directory
  \item combined_file: path to saved .rds file
}
}
\description{
Modeling function that constructs hypervolume models for each
cross-validation fold using either Gaussian kernel density estimation or
one-class SVM. Each hypervolume reserves one fold as testing data and uses
remaining folds as training data.
}
\details{
For N folds, constructs N hypervolumes where each reserves one fold for
testing. Overlap statistics quantify similarity between hypervolumes, with
low overlap suggesting distinct environmental spaces across folds.

Hypervolume models are used by \code{\link{generate_spatiotemporal_predictions}}
to project habitat suitability across space and time.
